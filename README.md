Website is live at: https://stock-prediction-roan.vercel.app

Frontend is hosted on Vercel and uses React and Vite.

Backend is hosted on Render and uses Express.js.
Because the backend is hosted on Render, the first api call might take a while.
Also because the backend is hosted by a free Render account, the prediction takes a while since I need to run a whole pytorch model.

The model currently used is a transformer that achieved over 80% directional accuracy.

This project is currently incomplete.
